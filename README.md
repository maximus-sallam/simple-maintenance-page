- URL is filled via JavaScript
- SVG favicon and colors respect dark/light mode (prefers-color-scheme)
- All graphics are inline SVGs so the whole page consists of only the index.html file. Gzipped it's around 3.6 KB
- Lighthouse 100 | 100 | 100 | 100

Just take the index.html, no need to change anything, and upload it where ever you want.
